Todo
----
- [X] Config
- [X] Client interface
- [X] StreamingClient
- [X] Unit tests
- [X] Handle feature_delete events
- [X] Compare versions when "feature" event is received (don't just overwrite)
- [X] Allow notify / callback functions (add and remove)
- [X] Global "readyness" callback (either OK when data has arrived, or an error if there was a fail)
- [X] Analytics support
- [X] Google Analytics support
- [X] Removed support for server-side ClientContext, and submit this as an x-featurehub header upon connection
- [ ] Run tests and code-generation inside Docker (instead of requiring Go to be installed locally)
- [X] Client-side rollout strategies (https://github.com/featurehub-io/featurehub/tree/master/backend/sse-strategy-matchers/src)

Strategy matching logic:
- If strategy has a percentage then hash on userkey or session and decide
- If the percentage doesn't match then continue with the next strategy
- If percentage matches (or there is no percentage) then continue and iterate through the attributes
	- If the attribute doesn't match then fall back and continue with the next strategy
	- If attribute matches then continue and check the next attribute
	- If all attributes match then we return the value from this strategy
	- Otherwise continue with the next strategy
- If no strategies match then return the default value for the feature
